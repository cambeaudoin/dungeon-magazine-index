# dungeon-magazine-index
There is a lot of great D&D content out there. Nothing is really new and the best DMs steal content and work it into something truly their own.

This repo is a simple page that indexes all the adventures from Dungeon Magazine when it was being published. There was no way to sort the content in the past, so here it is.

You can see a working page here: http://dmadventures.comeze.com/

Enjoy!

I am not the lawful owner of any of the adventures published. I'm pretty sure they're all owned by Wizards of the Coast.

## TODO:

- Filter doesn't work properly for featured adventures
- Need a clear all button
